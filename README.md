**Observation:**
**Weekday Vs Weekend total flights statistics:**
The analysis shows that there are significantly more flights on weekdays compared to weekends, with only 26% of the total flights on weekends and 74% on weekdays. One possible reason for this could be that airline tickets are generally more expensive on weekends, making it less attractive for travelers to fly during the weekends. The top 5 airlines for both weekdays and weekends are Southwest, Delta, American, SkyWest, and Atlantic Airlines. This information can help airlines to strategize their operations and marketing campaigns to cater to the different travel patterns of passengers during weekdays and weekends.

**Total number of cancelled flights for JetBlue Airways on the first date of every month:**
June had the highest number of cancelled flights for JetBlue Airways with a total of 55 cancellations. Bad weather conditions and the high demand during this busy travel season could be the primary reasons for the cancellations during this month. National Air System Delay was the most common cause of cancellations, accounting for 46 cancellations, followed by carrier delay (7) and weather delay (2). The highest number of cancellations was from John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) to Gen. Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport (BOS). Airlines can use this data to identify the busiest travel season and plan accordingly to minimize flight cancellations.

**Week-wise, State-wise, and City-wise statistics of flight delays with airline details:**
According to the analysis, Spirit Airlines experienced the most delays due to airline delay, while Southwest Airlines Co. had the highest number of cancellations due to bad weather. The most common reason for flight delays across airlines was airline delay. Bad weather was the leading cause of flight cancellations across airlines. On average, Delaware (DE) had the highest delays due to being a small regional airport. Airlines can use this data to improve their operations, including adjusting their schedules, implementing better contingency plans for weather disruptions, and improving airline services to minimize airline-related delays.

**Number of airlines with no departure/arrival delay with distance covered between 2500 and 3000:**
The analysis shows that United Airlines (UA) had the highest number of flights without any departure or arrival delay, followed by American Airlines (AA) and Alaska Airlines (AS). This suggests that passengers prefer these airlines when traveling long distances without any delays. On the other hand, US Airlines had the least number of preferred airlines, with an average higher delay in some of their airlines. Airlines can use this information to improve their operations, including implementing better scheduling, improving service quality, and enhancing their overall airline experience to reduce delays and improve customer satisfaction.
